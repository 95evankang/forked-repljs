# repo-with-repl-nodejs

Import this repo to create a starting point for Node.js projects in repl.it.

Once you have a copy of this repo imported, create a repl that has the same name to keep things straight.

Delete index.js from the repl and clone your repo using a dot (period) at the end of the line to remove sub-folders:

git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git .

Once the repo is successfully cloned, you should be able to run the test index.js file!

PS: There is a .gitignore to prevent node modules from being stored in the repo.

There is also a .replit file that helps repl.it recognize the starting point of the application.
